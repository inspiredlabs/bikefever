    history:
      - "Castelletto’s name originated from an Austro-Hungarian fortress once dominating the city; demolished during a 1530 revolt led by wealthy Genoese families, its stones were reused to build today's elegant belvedere buildings."
    mobility:
      - "Ascensore Castelletto Ponente: from Piazza della Meridiana, ideal to transport bikes."
      - "Ascensore Castelletto Levante: Liberty-style living gem; its top offers one of Genoa’s finest panoramas—on clear mornings you can even see Corsica."
      - "Funicolare Zecca–Righi: from Largo Zecca, stops include San Nicola (Salita Madonnetta) and Montegalletto (Castelli area)."
