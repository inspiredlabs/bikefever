# BikeFever.tech with `Embedded Intelligence`

## About

BikeFever.tech with `Embedded Intelligence` is an experiment that can breathe new life into `RSS`. The aim is to filter `RSS` feeds on an external server and store the simple results on customer's devices and solve their day-to-day problems.

These customers include:

- tourists with identical queries and questions
- regular customers with predictable needs that should be able to use a self-service portal to find their answer
- missed opportunities. The customers that arrive when the business is closed such as very early in the morning, very late in the evening or Tuesday.

### Why Bike Fever?

The procedural nature of these high-value, yet repetitive tasks is ideal for automation.

By using `#webAI` (Google's `Embedded Intelligence`), we can quickly see what patterns are:
- adoptable using on-device AI, `Embedded Intelligence` or simply access to relevant information at the time of need.
- what AI tasks are better suited to servers (med/long-term).
- what should remain as exclusive and in-person concierge services.

> What is high-value about these tasks? **Bike Fever** is both a physical shop renting and selling expensive small-parts AND also an information-rich business. It connects tourists and locals with places to visit, things to see and do and provides accurate directions and trustworthy specialist guidence.

## Faculties DTO

<!--
[Faculties DTO](https://gist.github.com/inspiredlabs/1a7ec5b76588be69b9495b7af84884ca) explains how I propse we experiment with Google's `#webAI`, before the release of `Gemma 3`. -->

> The world has changed. We no longer use search engines in the tradtional way. Previously, we'd look for an answer with our stated goal in our mind's eye – and for an answer?  **We'd know it when we see it!**

Now, we simply offload the searching to AI. The most useful in mid-2025 seem to be Perplexity, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Calude 4 Sonet, ChatGPT and Bing (aka. Copilot). They solve our problems in the following and similar way:

- we input long-queries written via a keyboard, or voice.
- their server returns an answer. That establishes the context of what we aim to do.
- we refine our query with more specifity based on this context.
- the server returns an updated answer. Hopefully matching our desired outcome.
- &hellip;& repeat.

### What is your proposal?

Now we've established how AI on a server works – I propse we experiment with Google's `#webAI`, before the release of `Gemma 3`.

We replicate the model above, but for narrow tasks. The first narrow task is for tourism and "Things to do in Genova, Italia".

> I can imagine a system such as **Time Out, London**, but it's an AI loaded and ready to go!

#### What is a "DTO"?

A Data Template Object is simply the _shape_ of the data so we know what we need to generate and consume in our App.

DTO:
- `url`
- `title`
- `exerpt`
- `author`
- `datetime` (automatically generated)
<!-- - `version` (automatically appended) -->

## InstantWebapp – rethinking web-design itself

### Template System

[InstantWebapp](https://www.instantwebapp.com/) is Scott Phillips' flagship product. It is a template system  <!--started 15 years agi-->  based on the principles of `Human Interaction Design`. It's poised for a redesign.

#### Patterns for the agentic web

> Let's be real, Wordpress, Shopify and content federation systems are based on poorly constructed meta data and bloated images – AI simply can not deal with it

Content federation systems (such as [Hygraph](https://hygraph.com/), have basicially failed. Let's use this as an opportunity to update common `Human Interaction Design` patterns for the web.

<!-- or other GraphQL/database layers), could be turned to better serve AI. -->

In the past Designers and Developers would refer to different kinds of people as "users", but this is about to change... because there's a new user, and given the right conditions, they are _THE_ Power User!

## Power Users Unite

Two different kinds of Power User:

When I use `Perplexity`, `Claude 4` or `Gemini 2.5 Pro` to help build sophisticated software such as Python automations, webapps and games I have to _make the problem addressable_. That means I need to help myself break tasks into small workable chunks to help me understand the core of the problem.

What am I doing with AI at the moment, and what _exactly_ do I mean by sophisticated software?

- I am an application level developer. That means I need to use `Python` to write useful automations, computer vision projects (with `OpenCV`), and help structure `API` to consume unstructured data for web-server applications for business like **National Geographic**, or structured data for on-device use such as for **The WHO**.
- [Medixplore.app](https://medixplore.app), I have developed a system using `InstantWebapp` templates to generate hundreds of apps for the medical services industry. There's more – a new business is emerging with `Stem Cell Technology` providers, they too can tailor their services to individual clients using this platform.
- I write conditional logic all day long for webapps and other code that runs in the browser and on-device, such as [MixedRealityGam.es](https://MixedRealityGam.es) using `Embedded Intelligence`, such as `WebAI` and graphics like `ThreeJS`.

To work on problems like these I have to understand how to
_make the problem addressable_, I am a Power User.

> Power Users need to unite to empower AI to get even more done.
