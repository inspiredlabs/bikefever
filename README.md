# BikeFever.tech with `Embedded Intelligence`

## About

BikeFever.tech with `Embedded Intelligence` is an experiment that can breathe new life into `RSS`. The aim is to filter `RSS` feeds on an external server and store the simple results on customer's devices and solve their day-to-day problems.

These customers include:

- tourists with identical queries and questions
- regular customers with predictable needs that should be able to use a self-service portal to find their answer
- missed opportunities. The customers that arrive when the business is closed such as very early in the morning, very late in the evening or Tuesday.

### Why Bike Fever?

The procedural nature of these high-value, yet repetitive tasks is ideal for automation.

By using `#webAI` (Google's `Embedded Intelligence`), we can quickly see what patterns are:
- adoptable using on-device AI, `Embedded Intelligence` or simply access to relevant information at the time of need.
- what AI tasks are better suited to servers (med/long-term).
- what should remain as exclusive and in-person concierge services.

> What is high-value about these tasks? **Bike Fever** is both a physical shop renting and selling expensive small-parts AND also an information-rich business. It connects tourists and locals with places to visit, things to see and do and provides accurate directions and trustworthy specialist guidence.

## Faculties DTO

<!--
[Faculties DTO](https://gist.github.com/inspiredlabs/1a7ec5b76588be69b9495b7af84884ca) explains how I propse we experiment with Google's `#webAI`, before the release of `Gemma 3`. -->

> The world has changed. We no longer use search engines in the tradtional way. Previously, we'd look for an answer with our stated goal in our mind's eye – and for an answer?  **We'd know it when we see it!**

Now, we simply offload the searching to AI. The most useful in mid-2025 seem to be Perplexity, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Calude 4 Sonet, ChatGPT and Bing (aka. Copilot). They solve our problems in the following and similar way:

- we input long-queries written via a keyboard, or voice.
- their server returns an answer. That establishes the context of what we aim to do.
- we refine our query with more specifity based on this context.
- the server returns an updated answer. Hopefully matching our desired outcome.
- &hellip;& repeat.

### What is your proposal?

Now we've established how AI on a server works – I propse we experiment with Google's `#webAI`, before the release of `Gemma 3`.

We replicate the model above, but for narrow tasks. The first narrow task is for tourism and "Things to do in Genova, Italia".

> I can imagine a system such as **Time Out, London**, but it's an AI loaded and ready to go!

#### What is a "DTO"?

A Data Template Object is simply the _shape_ of the data so we know what we need to generate and consume in our App.

DTO:
- `url`
- `title`
- `exerpt`
- `author`
- `datetime` (automatically generated)
<!-- - `version` (automatically appended) -->
